## Kaggle Notebooks (Kernels)

> #### **What is Kaggle?**
> Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learners. Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.
